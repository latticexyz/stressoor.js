# stressoor.js

Stressoor.js makes it simple to write complete, rigorous blockchain stress-tests.

We implemented fundamental stressing, measuring, and reporting primitives so you don't have to code them up from scratch.

Stressoor.js is made to build on top of. If you just want to stress-test a chain or see an example of this library in use, check out [chain-stress-tests](https://github.com/latticexyz/chain-stress-tests).

## Stressoor 101 [WIP]

The core function of stressoor is `runStressTest`. See it's [extensively commented code](/src/Core.ts) to get a deep understanding of how it works (_coming soon_).
